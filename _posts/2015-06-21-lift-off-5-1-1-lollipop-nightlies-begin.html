<p>Over the past few months our staff and contributors have been working diligently in order to deliver the best user experience that we can. At this point in time, we have confidence in the stability of our codebase, and as such 5.1.1 nightly releases based on Android Lollipop have begun! This initial roll out includes the following devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>ASUS Transformer Pad (tf300t)</li>
<li>ASUS Transformer Pad Infinity (tf700t)</li>
<li>Google Nexus 4 (mako)</li>
<li>Google Nexus 5 (hammerhead)</li>
<li>Google Nexus 6 (shamu)</li>
<li>Google Nexus 7 (flo)</li>
<li>Google Nexus 10 (manta)</li>
<li>Oppo Find 7/7a (find7)</li>
<li>Oneplus One (find7op)</li>
<li>Sony Xperia Z (yuga)</li>
<li>Sony Xperia ZL (odin)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are the owner of any of these devices, hop on over to our <a href="http://dl.omnirom.org/">download page</a> and join the party! Please be advised that if you were previously on an unofficial or homemade build, <strong>you will need to perform a clean flash/wipe data when moving to nightly builds, or you will end up in a boot loop.</strong></p>
<p>As always, we are working hard to expand our device roster, and will roll out nightlies to more devices over time and as we have maintainers to do so. Please refer to our <a href="http://omnirom.org/general/status-update-omnirom-lollipop/">Lollipop status update post</a> for some FAQs, as well as our <a href="http://docs.omnirom.org/Lollipop_Device_Status">device status wiki page</a> for the latest updates on device support. Happy flashing!</p>
