<p>With Christmas and New Years fast approaching, it's time to look at December 2016 and all we have been working on.</p>
<h1>Device Announcements</h1>
<p>Some new devices, and old favorites, are receiving updates courtesy of our Device Maintainers. Feel free to test them out, with the typical disclaimer that these are test builds, and as such know there may be issues which pop up until the device(s) move to Nightly Status.</p>
<h2>Android 7.1.1 Device Updates</h2>
<p>The good old Oppo Find 7 is not dead yet. Thanks to work done by <strong>maxwen</strong>, <strong>Darkobas</strong>, and <strong>Philipp</strong> it was a breeze to bring new life into this still solid device. You can find the test builds on <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/find-7/find7-orig-development/7-1-omni-testbuild-oppo-find7-t3510373" target="_blank">XDA</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to be outdone, the little twin to the Find 7, the OnePlus One, is also back into action thanks to <strong>Philipp</strong> and <strong>Darkobas</strong>. Wi-Fi Hotspot and SELinux Permissive are known issues at this time, but will be fixed soon. You can find the test builds on <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4GudGp6dLOASEVySml4NEhJc3c/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">GDrive</a>.</span></p>
<p>Android One 2nd Generation (codename seed), the msm8916 variant of Google’s Android One project, now runs OmniRom 7.1.1 courtesy of <strong>arvinquilao</strong>, with able help from <strong>kldoc</strong> for camcorder fix. The test builds can be downloaded via <a href="https://www.androidfilehost.com/?fid=745425885120692436" target="_blank">AFH</a>.</p>
<h2>Omni Welcomes Sony Xperia X Compact</h2>
<p>The Sony Xperia X Compact (kugo) has joined the Omni ranks thanks to <strong>oshmoun</strong>, the device maintainer, with help from <strong>humberos</strong>. Currently this device is on the Android 6.0 branch as there are still some missing functions for Android 7.x, mainly camera which is a work in progress.</p>
<h1>Team Updates</h1>
<p>OmniROM has evolved a lot since it's creation, with many of its initial founding members currently taking a break for work or life reasons. Today we have a good, core group of device maintainers working to keep current devices in line where possible, and bringing on new devices as work load and availability of new device maintainers allow. One thing hasn't changed, and that is that we are all passionate about Android and we really enjoy working together with our community to make OmniROM better every day. If you're interested in joining the team and contributing to Omni do not hesitate to <a href="https://omnirom.org/contributors/volunteer/" target="_blank">let us know</a>.</p>
<p>A few key notes of administration are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>kldoc</strong> is taking over as device maintainer on the OnePlus 3 from <strong>Maxwen</strong> so that he can continue to focus on core features of Omni like <a href="https://omnirom.org/features/easily-switch-apps-omniswitch/" target="_blank">OmniSwitch</a>, <a href="https://omnirom.org/general/opendelta-brings-incremental-system-updates-omni/" target="_blank">OpenDelta</a>, and so on</li>
<li>Due to contributions from OnePlus and XDA, <strong>scanno</strong>, <strong>Bumble-Bee</strong>, and <strong>kldoc</strong> will be bringing up the OnePlus 3T as the initial device maintainers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for all of your support and we look forward to a great 2017!</p>
