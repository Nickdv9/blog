**Weekly Build Update**

As of today, we are adding the OnePlus 5T to our weekly build list. With this addition, OmniROM is the first to provide a stable Android 8.1 build for the 5T! You can find the [new builds](http://dl.omnirom.org/oneplus5t/) on our download server.

All thanks go to *darkobas* for this new addition to our Android 8.1 device list!
