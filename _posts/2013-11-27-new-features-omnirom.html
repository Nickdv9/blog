<p>With <a title="Well What Do We Have Here?" href="http://omnirom.org/general/well-what-do-we-have-here/">nightlies rolling out</a>, we thought it would be a good opportunity to detail the new features that are rolling out right along with them.</p>
<h2><strong>Incoming call - the non-intrusive way</strong></h2>
<p>Instead of having a fullscreen let you know when that annoying relative is calling to ask you for the umpteenth time how to use "the Google" when you're playing a game, or browsing a website - how about having a sleek and non-intrusive popup that slides up from the bottom of the screen, similar to a card? From there, you can easily dismiss or accept a call.</p>

<h2><b>DSP Manager Enhancements</b></h2>
<p>There's nothing better than being able to be in full control of your audio - especially when you are sitting in that crowded coffee shop and want to drown out the hipster crooning to Miley Cyrus. So to give you that control, we've made the following enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Center frequency for Bass Boost:</strong></em> Some of you like kicks, some of you like harmonics. Those play at different frequency, so you can now adjust the center frequency of the bass boost effect to get a better bass sound.</li>
<li><em><strong>Stereo widening:</strong></em> Like Daft Punk? You'll like it even more along with all your other songs too. We've introduced a new stereo-widening effect, enhancing the stereo image of your songs.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<ul>
<li><strong>ActiveDisplay is back</strong>
<ul>
<li>ActiveDisplay is blah blah blah - you know what it does, but now it has some new features!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Apps permissions</strong>
<ul>
<li>You can now control per-app permissions in Settings &gt; Apps permissions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>And various minor additions and enhancements - with more to come!</strong></p>
<p>We do have some really cool things coming down the pipe soon - things you've never seen before, so stay tuned!</p>
