<p>Omni, a new community-driven ROM, was announced at the <a href="http://bigandroidbbq.com/" target="_blank">Big Android BBQ 2013</a> this past weekend. If you were unable to attend, XDA was kind enough to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXlzJ4WVDKY" target="_blank">record the presentation</a> given by XDA Elite Recognized Developer XpLoDWilD. The response has been overwhelmingly positive, and we are excited to see things take off like they have.</p>
<p>This post is a start to what will be a pretty regular update about all the goings on with Omni.</p>
<h2>Interview</h2>
<p>At the BABBQ, Jordan with XDA TV interviewed XpLoDWilD about his accomplishments and a little about himself. Make sure to catch the video below.</p>

<h2>Thank You</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, the response to this project has been absolutely amazing. We are so excited to see where this can go, and it will take you, the community, to continue it's growth. Head on over to <a title="Get Involved" href="http://omnirom.org/get-involved/">Get Involved</a> and find out the different ways you can help contribute to Omni.</p>
<p>We also want to thank those who have already been contributing. You can find them on <a title="Contributors" href="http://omnirom.org/contributors/">Contributors</a>, where we'll keep updating those based on merged Gerrit change requests.</p>
<h2>Coverage</h2>
<p>As is often the case with a project like this, there are some misconceptions that we would like to clear up.</p>
<div>
<div dir="ltr">
<p>First, we are not trying to "compete" against projects like CyanogenMod, AOKP, and ParanoidAndroid. We just love Android. Much of the Omni team hangs out daily on XDA, IRC, and other mediums, and we are constantly working with, supporting, and asking questions of the entire community. Our goal is to experiment with Android development because we enjoy it. Omni isn't better, just different. It's another option for the billion Android users out there. Android (vs. iOS and every other mobile OS) has thrived on options as well as the gigantic, talented development community that has emerged to build those options. That's the beauty of Android - that you can pick and choose from a smorgasbord of devices with varying features and functionality.</p>
<p>Secondly, we love CM and immensely respect the entire team there and their contributions to the community at-large. It's a great product, and if they can get 300 million users, that would be amazing for everyone. We are conscious of people who think we're scavenging disgruntled developers from other projects. This is not our goal. We have positioned Omni as being about the community, and we will not abide bashing of other custom ROM projects. We will do our best to find common ground in the spirit of collaboration and cooperation.</p>
