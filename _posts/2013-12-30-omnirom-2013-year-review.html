<p>A lot has happened in the few, short months that Omni has <a title="An Exciting Beginning" href="http://omnirom.org/general/an-exciting-beginning/" target="_blank">been public</a> and we thought it would be a great opportunity to reflect on the last 3 months and to look to the future. After going public the middle of October with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXlzJ4WVDKY" target="_blank">a presentation by XpLoDWilD</a> at the BABBQ 13, we have had contributions from over 90 <a title="Contributors" href="http://omnirom.org/contributors/" target="_blank">contributors</a>, deployed over <a title="New Devices Added to Nightly Builds" href="http://omnirom.org/devices/new-devices-added-nightly-builds/" target="_blank">30 nightly builds</a>, brought some <a title="New Features for OmniROM" href="http://omnirom.org/features/new-features-omnirom/" target="_blank">new, open source features</a> to the Android community for all to use, and deployed <a title="OpenDelta Brings Incremental System Updates to Omni" href="http://omnirom.org/general/opendelta-brings-incremental-system-updates-omni/" target="_blank">OpenDelta</a> - all in just over 3 months. Whew!</p>
<p>Since Oct 13, 2013 we have seen over 656K unique visitors check out our website, <a href="http://docs.omnirom.org" target="_blank">Wiki</a>, and <a href="https://gerrit.omnirom.org" target="_blank">Gerrit</a> instances. That is really just phenomenal for a new project like this, and we thank the community for embracing another option in the Android open source world.</p>
<p>Our focus has been, and will remain, on our core goals of improvement. With that being said, it is interesting to see which devices are getting the most interest in the community. The below table displays the cumulative nightly downloads for each device since we began offering nightly builds, and is in no way indicative of number of users or actual installs:</p>

<p>We are excited for all that 2014 holds, and so we thought we would give you a little taste of what is in store, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Unique privacy and security features to help you fold your obligatory tin foil hat</span></li>
<li>Increased device support</li>
<li>Dancing penguins doing the "robot"</li>
<li>UI/UX Enhancements</li>
<li>Many more to come...</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you to each and every one of you who have helped to make Omni what it is, and here's to 2014.</p>
