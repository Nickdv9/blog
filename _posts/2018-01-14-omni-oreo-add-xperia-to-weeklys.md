**Weekly Build Update**


As of today, we are adding the Sony Xperia X, X Compact, XZ and XZs to our weekly build list.


 - Sony Xperia X [[suzu](http://dl.omnirom.org/suzu/)]
 - Sony Xperia X Compact [[kugo](http://dl.omnirom.org/kugo/)]
 - Sony Xperia XZ [[kagura](http://dl.omnirom.org/kagura/)]
 - Sony Xperia XZs [[keyaki](http://dl.omnirom.org/keyaki/)]


The device bringup is based on device trees from Sony's Open Devices Project.
Note that in order to get the builds booting, a separate OEM image needs to be flashed using fastboot.

```
$ fastboot flash oem [firmware_name]
```

Further information about that can be found in the respective XDA threads.  
All thanks go to *humberos* and *oshmoun* for this new addition to our Android 8.1 device list!
