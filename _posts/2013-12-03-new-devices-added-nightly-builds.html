<p>Since we last told you about <a title="Well What Do We Have Here?" href="http://omnirom.org/general/well-what-do-we-have-here/">nightlies kicking off</a> (shouldn't "nightlies" already be a word in the dictionary?), our device contributors have been hard at work, and we're pleased to announce a few more devices to add to <a title="Supported Devices" href="http://omnirom.org/supported-devices/" target="_blank">the mix</a>:</p>
<h2>1. Oppo N1</h2>
<p>Entropy512, maxwen, xplodwild and RaYmAn have been hard at work bringing up the first source-built, Android 4.4 ROM for the Oppo N1 and last weekend you were able to see the <a href="http://dl.omnirom.org/n1/" target="_blank">fruits of their labor</a>. This huge, true phablet-of-a-phone (did we mention <em>HUGE</em>?) is the latest from the current darling of the Android OS development scene, <a href="http://en.oppo.com" target="_blank">Oppo</a>. If you're lucky enough to have one of these now, go ahead and give Omni a spin.</p>
<h2>2. Sony Xperia T, Z, and ZL</h2>
<p>Sony's Xperia lineup has long had support from various teams like FXP and CM and we're glad to be able to bring a few of them (so far) into Omni's fold. Tilal6991, Entropy512, and a few others have both been spending time on these (and other Sony) devices over the last month or so, and are happy to get the <a href="http://dl.omnirom.org/mint/" target="_blank">Mint</a>, <a href="http://dl.omnirom.org/yuga/" target="_blank">Yuga</a> and <a href="http://dl.omnirom.org/odin/" target="_blank">Odin</a> up and going.</p>
<h2>3. HTC One (AT&amp;T and International)</h2>
<p>HTC's top device of 2013 rounds out the list of new devices to recently receive nightly support. Maxwen, Yuma and a few others spent the time migrating the <a href="http://dl.omnirom.org/m7ul/" target="_blank">m7ul</a> and <a href="http://dl.omnirom.org/m7att/" target="_blank">m7att</a>Â to Android 4.4, and it's been definitely appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks again to all of the <a title="Contributors" href="http://omnirom.org/contributors/" target="_blank">contributors</a> who are helping to make Omni a truly community-driven project, and here's to a bright future ahead!</p>
