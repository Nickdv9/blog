<p><img class="alignright wp-image-693 size-medium" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/sony-xperia-l-158x300.png" alt="sony-xperia-l" width="158" height="300" />In the custom ROM community, we find that developers focus mainly on high-end devices while the lower-end device often go ignored. Most of the time it is not because these devices are not capable enough to run custom firmware, but simply because there is a lack of interest. However, that is not the case with the Sony Xperia L. Codenamed "taoshan", the L has a 1GHz dual-core Qualcomm <span style="color: #000000;">MSM8230 with Adreno 305 graphics. Nightlies have been kicked off for this device as of today, thanks to the efforts by <a title="Contributors" href="http://omnirom.org/contributors/">community member</a> Olivier.</span></p>
<p>Community members are a crucial part of Omni, and we always welcome new members into the Omni family, whether you are a user or a developer. This also serves as a reminder that just because newer and greater devices have come out, we do not simply neglect older, less capable devices.</p>
<p>Owners of the Xperia L may head to the <a href="http://dl.omnirom.org/taoshan/" target="_blank">download page</a> to get started on enjoying some OmniROM KitKat goodness! As always, updates later on will be available through our <a title="OpenDelta Brings Incremental System Updates to Omni" href="http://omnirom.org/general/opendelta-brings-incremental-system-updates-omni/">OpenDelta</a> incremental updater, as this is now an officially supported device. Lastly, should you have issues, please feel free to report them to our <a href="http://jira.omnirom.org/" target="_blank">JIRA instance</a>.</p>
