<p>The Find 7 is the spectacular 2014 flagship from Oppo, a Chinese-based company already well-known for their great developer support across the custom Android firmware world. They have opened their arms to the aftermarket firmware projects, like ourselves, even going so far as encouraging its users to try out different ROMs through various posts and polls. To further that development, they provided numerous devices to the OmniROM project and two of our lead developers, Entropy512 and maxwen, began working on the device.</p>
<p>The flagship seemed to have almost everything right: A big, beautiful 5.5in screen (1080p for the 7a, 2K for the 7), top-of-the-line specs, a very nice camera, and the <a href="https://9to5google.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/screen-shot-2014-08-08-at-12-22-55-pm.png">gorgeous skyline LED notification light</a>. Unfortunately, for all the good they have done, they did do one thing wrong: the internal storage is set up in the legacy Android fashion, with the /data partition separate from the user-accessible internal storage. This was a great peeve to most users who were accustomed to the unified internal storage solution Google introduced with the Galaxy Nexus and Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0. Oppo, if you're reading this, <em><strong>please fix this for your next phone</strong></em>!</p>
<p>This was also one of the issues that our devs wanted to tackle before officially pushing the Find 7 into nightlies. Now, after a few months of hard work fixing bugs and issues, Entropy512 and maxwen have deemed the device ready for the nightly roster, and have also provided a <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=55081626&amp;postcount=546">LVM-based solution that unifies the Find 7's internal storage</a>, for users who wish to proceed down that route.</p>
<p>The nightly builds are <a href="http://dl.omnirom.org/find7/">now available for download</a>, <strong>and are compatible with BOTH unified and non-unified internal storage formats.</strong> Please note that this is a unified build that is intended for <strong>BOTH</strong> the Find 7 and the 7a variant. Happy flashing! And remember to report any bugs you encounter to our <a href="http://jira.omnirom.org/">JIRA instance</a>.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Entropy512 has also put together a very helpful reference for <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/find-7/orig-development/ref-lvm-partition-remapping-t2865843" target="_blank">LVM Partition Mapping</a>. We encourage you read it and become familiar with the functionality.</p>
