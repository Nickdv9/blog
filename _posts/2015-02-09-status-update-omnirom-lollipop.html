<p>Not too long ago we let you know the <a title="Android L on OmniROM Is Progressing" href="http://omnirom.org/general/android-l-omnirom-progressing/" target="_blank">progress on rolling out Lollipop</a> on OmniROM, and the positive response was greatly appreciated. We are edging closer to nightlies for Lollipop, and figured now would be a good time to answer some common questions:</p>
<h2>Why no more 4.4.x nightlies?</h2>
<p>Our goal at OmniROM has always been to balance providing support for legacy OS versions and devices, while also providing the latest and greatest versions of Android for current devices. To balance these two (often) competing priorities, we will continue to provide security and critical bug fixes which can either be backported, or solved through a code fix for previous versions and devices which will no longer receive nightly support.</p>
<h2>Where can I find out more information on Lollipop status for my device?</h2>
<p>We have setup a page on our <a href="http://docs.omnirom.org/" target="_blank">wiki</a> which identifies the Device, the Maintainer(s), the Status and any Open Issues on the range of devices currently being worked on for Lollipop. You can find it <a href="http://docs.omnirom.org/Lollipop_Device_Status" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Why is my device not listed as slated for Lollipop?</h2>
<p>We do everything possible to support as many devices as we can. That, however, is not always feasible. Some factors that can keep this from happening:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scumbag OEM doesn't provide their required (or in the case of Samsung, promised) kernel source code</li>
<li>OEM has dropped support for their device going forward and their previous drivers are not compatible with Lollipop and beyond</li>
<li>There is no one stepping up to become a Maintainer for that device</li>
</ul>
<p>That last one is an important one. Some of the devices that are not (currently) set to receive Lollipop, but could support it and had 4.4.x on it, is due to there being no one to maintain that device. Anyone can step up in our <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=omni" target="_blank">#omni Freenode</a> channel and volunteer to be the Maintainer, but that "title" requires that you have experience in platform development for that device, you have the ability to do so, and that you have the device.</p>
<p>To point number one and two, a good example would be all Exynos4 devices (except for N80xx) which are considered dropped as of this moment while a new set of maintainers are learning the ropes.</p>
<h2>What are requirements for a device to reach "nightly" status?</h2>
<p>It's often asked how a device reaches the legendary "nightly" status on OmniROM, and these are the three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Active, well-known, and experienced maintainer</li>
<li>SElinux in enforcing mode</li>
<li>Full-functional <a href="http://teamw.in/project/twrp2" target="_blank">recovery build</a> for the device</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully we've answered all of your questions, and if not, please provide comments in the <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/115526355605398943780/posts/cNwVLmcFLYK" target="_blank">G+ post</a>.</p>
