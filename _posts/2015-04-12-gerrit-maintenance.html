<p>We will shortly be doing some important maintenance on the OmniROM gerrit, in order to support authentication after Google <a href="https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OpenID2">deprecates OpenID</a> in the next week or so.</p>
<p>Gerrit should be considered at-risk and out-of-service while we carry out this maintenance. As a reminder, source code can still be accessed from out <a href="https://github.com/OmniROM">Github repositories</a> for any Sunday code-fests you had been looking forward to.</p>
<p>Apologies in advance for any inconvenience caused - we were held back in waiting for upstream Gerrit to support a usable migration path away from OpenID. We'll let you know once it's all working again. (Fingers crossed!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
