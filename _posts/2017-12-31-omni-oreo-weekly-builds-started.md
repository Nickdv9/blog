**Happy New Year 2018**

As of today we are starting our weekly builds for Android O (8.1) with 3 devices.

The devices are:

 - Oneplus 3(T) [[oneplus3](http://dl.omnirom.org/oneplus3/)]
 - Oneplus 5 [[oneplus5](http://dl.omnirom.org/oneplus5/)]
 - Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 [[gts210vewifi](http://dl.omnirom.org/gts210vewifi/)]

Thanks to maxwen, darkobas and scanno! Of course more devices will be added soon, but as usual no ETA :-P .

We also wanted to say THANK YOU to the community and all supporters of OmniROM this last year. Some advice for the new Year from us ;-)

 - don't drink and drive
 - plant a tree
 - don't ask for ETA's
 - build a house
 - be nice

HAPPY NEW YEAR 2018!!!
