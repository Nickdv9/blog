<p><strong>Update: Gerrit has arisen once more from the ashes! We've also updated to Gerrit 2.9 during the time offline.</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to our server hosts' <a href="http://www.hetzner-status.de/en.html#3738">datacenter not having suitable power redundancy</a> in place we have had an outage on the Omni gerrit instance, which is taking a bit longer to recover from than expected.</p>
<p>We've got plenty of backups, and we're working to get it back up soon. Until then, here is a picture of a duckling, to entertain you while we hit the server with a spanner.</p>
