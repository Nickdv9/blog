<p>The goal of Omni is to experiment with Android development because we enjoy it. Omni isn’t better, just different. It’s another option for the billion Android users out there. Android (vs. iOS and every other mobile OS) has thrived on options as well as the gigantic, talented development community that has emerged to build those options. That’s the beauty of Android – that you can pick and choose from a smorgasbord of devices with varying features and functionality.</p>
<p>Omni is a chance to <a title="Get Involved" href="http://omnirom.org/get-involved/">get involved</a>, no matter who you are. Developers, whether you’ve been developing apps for a week, or ROM features for 3 years, <a title="Source Code" href="http://omnirom.org/source-code/">you’re welcome</a>. Users, we know you want to help out, and now you can - Omni actively encourages <a href="http://jira.omnirom.org">bug reports</a> and feature requests, which can be added to our publicly accessible roadmap. What’s the point in giving you a ROM, and forcing you to not tell us about any bugs you find?</p>
<p>We also recognise how people use Custom ROMs - we’re all custom ROM users and developers ourselves - the argument that “nightlies are not for end users” is over-used, and no longer valid. We’ve found that the vast majority of users want to get nightly updates to their ROM. For that reason, nightlies aren’t a playground - nightlies are for new features that are finished. You should be able to expect the same stability and reliability from a nightly as you would from a “release” ROM, and can report any bugs that prevent this from happening.</p>
<p>We know not everyone wants to update their ROM daily, and you are free to update as frequently or infrequently as you like. Omni is about flexibility and giving users what they expect - and we are excited to see where the community goes with it.</p>
