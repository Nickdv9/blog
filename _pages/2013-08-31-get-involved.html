<p>The core of Omni is the community, and we recognize that everyone has a role to play. So we have a number of ways for you to get involved:</p>
<p><a href="http://gerrit.omnirom.org" target="_blank">Gerrit</a> - view our project at the code level with the ability to see what's merged, what's open and what's in review.</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=2601" target="_blank">Forum</a> - participate in general discussion, Q&amp;A, and Features Development on XDA. Also find device-specific builds in their relevant forums on <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com" target="_blank">XDA</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=omnirom" target="_blank">IRC </a>- get involved with Omni in realtime on IRC Freenode:</p>
<ul>
<li>General discussion in <strong>#omnirom</strong></li>
<li>Developer discussion inÂ <strong>#omni</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
