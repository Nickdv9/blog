<p>One of the highest anticipated device releases in the Android community for 2014 has been the new offerings from Oppo. After coming to prominence on the back of the Find 5, and then becoming the first OEM to ship a custom ROM on a device with the N1, they've released the Find 7 in two flavors (7a currently and the 7 soon to follow). Oppo was kind enough to send out some 7a's to a few developers at Omni, one of whom was Entropy512.</p>
<p>After a few weeks of hair pulling and energy drinks, Entropy on May 20th rolled out the first Alpha for the Find 7a <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2758227" target="_blank">on XDA</a>. Ten days later he upgraded the 7a to <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=53045250" target="_blank">Beta status</a>, with the ROM being relatively stable. The only things that are keeping the 7a from moving to nightlies are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Camera superzoom</li>
<li>Mic on speakerphone</li>
<li>Off-mode (LPM) charging</li>
</ul>
