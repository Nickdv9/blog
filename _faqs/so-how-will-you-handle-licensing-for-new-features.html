<p>At its heart Omni is about the community and FOSS, and ensuring that open source software is able to be freely distributed without encumbrances. There are always challenges to this approach though, and one of those is licensing. Android carries the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache 2.0 license</a>Â while the Linux kernel carries with it the GNU Public License v2 (GPLv2), both of which have their own set of limitations as well as advantages. Together they form a pretty good working relationship, but there are challenges - one of which is where they are incompatible.</p>
<p>All new features will be created under GPLv3 where the licensing permits, usually based on elements being used. The advantages of GPLv3 are that it encourages, and ensures, that the spirit of open source is continued. The GNU GPL does not restrict what people do in software; it just stops them from restricting others (<a href="http://goo.gl/ZQeUld" target="_blank">1</a>).</p>
